## Modifications
[HeadCollisionHandler.cs](https://github.com/oscardelgado02/VR-Prototype---Prospective-Memory-Training/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/HeadClippingPrevention/HeadCollisionHandler.cs) was modified. Instead of moving the XR Rig with a Character Controller attached component, it uses its transform component.
